In terms of hardware, it may seem that the phone has pretty good specs for the price but it actually uses an underpowered Mediatek chipset. Also, I wish the phone had at least 32GB of internal storage.

I  am disappointed with the overall gaming performance. There are quite a few skipped frames and stutter even while playing a 4-year-old Asphalt 8 on the highest graphics. You will also see quite a few skipped frames in other games like Asphalt extreme or shadow fight 3. In addition, the phone gets hot quickly, just after 5 mins of gaming.

The phone runs on Android 8.1 out of the box but we have a custom Elephone skin built on top of it. That means that we have customized icons and a few added features. You can change the layout of navigation buttons and adjust other settings but in general, you get a pretty much stock android experie3nce.

The overall performance is underwhelming. There is quite a lot of stutter, many skipped frames and even lag while using the phone on the daily basis with many apps installed.
